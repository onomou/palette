# palette
An alternate interface for Canvas from Instructure, intended to speed up a teacher's daily tasks, like creating and grading assignments

```shell
git clone https://github.com/onomou/palette.git
cd palette
py -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
pip install -r requirements.txt
py dash_app.py
```

Definitely still a work in progress.
